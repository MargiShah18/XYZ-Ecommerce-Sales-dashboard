This is my first project on PowerBi where i did the following:
The project involved the development of a dynamic and interactive sales data analysis dashboard tailored for online sales. Using advanced data manipulation techniques, I integrated diverse data sources and constructed calculated measures to enable in-depth analysis. The dashboard boasted an array of customized visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and more, ensuring a comprehensive representation of sales trends. User-friendly features like filters and slicers allowed for seamless data exploration and actionable insights. This initiative aimed to empower stakeholders by providing a centralized platform for intuitive and informed decision-making based on intricate online sales data analysis.
